Iâ€™m a PhD candidate at the School of Foreign Studies, Nanjing University. I am particularly interested in How to Do Things with Prosody, inspired by Austin's book How to Do Things with Words. Additionally, I find the pragmatic phenomena in classical texts fascinating, as investigating these phenomena can help us understand history. As a PhD student specializing in applied linguistics, I have also been consistently engaged in research on second language acquisition.
